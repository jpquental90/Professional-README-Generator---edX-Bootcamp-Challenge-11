# Professional-README---edX-Bootcamp-Challenge-11

This repository contains my answer to the Module 11 Challenge of the Web Development edX bootcamp: https://jpquental90.github.io/Weather-Dashboard---edX-Bootcamp-Challenge-8/

## Description

My task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Installation

The application requires the use of Node.js and can be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Usage

#### Example of a generated README file

The current weather displays on the top right, and 5-day forecast displays on the bottom right. On the left side we have the search field in which a user can type a city name.
